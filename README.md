# Stench of Death

Makes bodies rot after a minute, causing flies to be attracted to them. Entirely
cosmetic and adds no new mechanics.

From Symbiosis mod before getting permanently removed in 1.0.6, which I thought
was a nice visual touch.

No configs are available, and the bundle is old as I'm still relatively new to
unity modding. The bundle was literally just ripped from Symbiosis as it
only includes the fly prefab.
