# Stench of Death

(Only tested on LC 72.)

Makes bodies rot after a minute, causing flies to be attracted to them.

From Symbiosis mod before getting permanently removed in 1.0.6, which I thought
was a nice visual touch.

No configs are available, and the bundle is old as I'm still relatively new to
unity modding and unsure how to rebuild for v73 (if i even have to - haven't tested.)
The bundle was literally just ripped from Symbiosis as it only includes the fly prefab.
